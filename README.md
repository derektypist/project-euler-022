# Project Euler 022 - Names Scores

Using an array `names`, containing over 5000 first names, begin by sorting into alphabetical order.  Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position to obtain a name score.

For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list.  So COLIN would obtain a score of 938 x 53 = 49714.

The aim is to find the total of all names scores in the array.

A [PDF File](pdf/names.pdf) containing the names is supplied.

## UX

As a user, I expect the function `namesScores(names)` to return a number.

As a user, I expect the function `namesScores(names)` to return 871198282.

**Information Architecture**

The function `namesScores(names)` returns a number, where `names` is an array.

## Features

Allows the user to view the PDF of the names as well as the total of all names scores in the array.  If time permitted, would have other names such as computer terms.

## Technologies

Uses HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Google Fonts and Bootstrap 5.2.0-Beta1.

## Testing

Ensure all user stories have been met.

## Deployment

Deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://derektypist.github.io/project-euler-022) at the main branch.

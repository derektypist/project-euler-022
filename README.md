# Project Euler 022 - Names Scores

Using an array `names`, containing over 5000 first names, begin by sorting into alphabetical order.  Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position to obtain a name score.

For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list.  So COLIN would obtain a score of 938 x 53 = 49714.

The aim is to find the total of all names scores in the array.
